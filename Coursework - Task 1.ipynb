An agent starts at the upper-left corner of the grid and must reach the lower-right corner of the grid as fast as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this baseline approach, the algorithm is only choosing values either to it's right or beneath it in order to progress towards the end point in the bottom right of the board. It will detect if it is at the edge of the board on either side at which point it will only move in the direction available. Slightly better than random movements as there is no likelihood for backtracking, however still not as efficient as possible as it cannot move up and around larger numbers in order to avoid high influences on the overall time as well as it does not consider the overall best route and will just take the smallest number between the right and bottom movements, meaning it could make a move right to increase time by 1, but then be forced by the edge to move down through many large numbers, not necessarily very efficient. As such I believe it to be a suitable baseline for this task."

    "Dijkstra's algorithm implemented below allows for movement up and down as well as back tracking through previous values to adjust and to make sure it is taking the optimal route by testing the distance from the starting point through to the ending point along a number of routes. In a sense it is somewhat of a brute force method and so is generally slower than more optimal algorithms, however still efficient at finding the correct route! It will alter these values in a dictionary of distances that allow it to optimise over time and find the shortest possible route, however this is almost a brute force method as it checks every possible node for it's distance from the starting point to the end point. Not as fast as something like the algorithm above but much more accurate."
