# Programming-and-Mathematics-for-AI-Coursework
Three Jupyter Notebook files containing my answers to the coursework tasks assigned in the Programming and Mathematics for AI module at City


## How to run
Each task is it's own notebook file, you can run each one by opening them as jupyter notebooks.
- Run `jupyter notebook <NOTEBOOK FILE NAME>`
- Inside each book, press each cell individually and `Shift + Enter` to run them, please do so sequentially

If a module error pops up, please install the respective module with either `pip install <MODULE>` or `conda install <MODULE>`
